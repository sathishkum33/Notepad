1. Centralized Management: ADO is centrally managed, and its processes are standardized across SCB, which I find beneficial for maintaining consistency and streamlining operations.



Cons:

1. Frequent Issues and Slowness: I frequently encounter performance issues and slowness with ADO, which affects my workflow and productivity.


2. Instability Due to Frequent Changes: The regular updates and changes in ADO often have a negative impact on its stability, causing disruptions in my work.


3. Lack of Immediate Support: When I report issues via email or ticketing systems, the response from the ADO team is often delayed, making it difficult to resolve problems quickly.
