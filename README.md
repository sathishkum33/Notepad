Hi John,
I would like to express my sincere appreciation for your exceptional support over the past few months. You played a key role in setting up the ADO dedicated agent for the DTX application, and your efforts have made a significant impact.
Thank you for tirelessly working through multiple installation attempts on the non-prod ADO environments, exploring different approaches, and ensuring everything was thoroughly tested. Your persistence and dedication were instrumental in finally making the agent available on the production ADO.
We truly appreciate your hard work, commitment, and continuous support throughout this process.
Thank you once again for your outstanding contribution.


Appreciation for Your Outstanding Support
