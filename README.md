I’d like to check if it’s feasible to enable APM monitoring on the XVZ application. This application is part of the FFG Project and is not associated with any Catalyst event.
Could you please confirm if APM monitoring can be enabled on COP for this application? If yes, kindly advise on the next steps or requirements.
Thanks in advance for your support.
