Dear [Dev Team],

I hope you're doing well.

To ensure stability and alignment across teams, we kindly request that no changes be made to the pipeline stages or configurations in Azure DevOps (ADO) without consulting the DevOps team.

Uncoordinated modifications can lead to missed updates, potential disruptions, and overlooked feedback from the testing team regarding pipeline improvements. To avoid these risks, please reach out to us before making any changes, so we can review and implement them appropriately.

If you have any suggestions or requirements for pipeline adjustments, feel free to coordinate with us, and weâ€™ll work together to ensure a smooth and efficient process.

Thanks for your cooperatio
