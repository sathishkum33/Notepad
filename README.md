Subject: No Breaker Identified – Pending ADO Template Customization

Dear [Recipient’s Name],

As part of release 1.79 (Aug 13th), Micro Focus was installed on the EC2 instance (custom agent). Following this, we had discussions with the central team regarding ADO template customization.

To avoid delays in the central team’s backlog, we have taken ownership of customizing the ADO governance templates. This work is being carried out by Airtel, with Capgemini only required to provide the build script.

Please note:

This pending task will not create any breaker for the current process.

We have a dedicated on-prem build server with a ready-to-use stage, which can be utilized until the new build agent is fully ready.


Hence, there is no risk to ongoing operations while the customization is in progress.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
